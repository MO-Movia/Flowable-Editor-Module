# Flowable-Editor-Module
Removed the BPMN editor out of the large 6.x flowable GUI into an independent A15 component.  It is still the Angular JS, but has an A15 wrapper to make it work nicely with newer Angular GUIs. This lets you build Flowable compatible BPMN (in JSON format - will need to convert to BPMN XML to place in .BAR file for process ingest) process.
